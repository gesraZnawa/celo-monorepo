# How to use FSUIPC 5.103 with Prepar3D 4.0
 
FSUIPC is a software module that allows you to interface with various flight simulators, such as Prepar3D (P3D), and control various aspects of your simulation, such as joystick calibration, weather injection, key mapping, and more. FSUIPC is developed by Pete and John Dowson, and you can find more information about their products on their website[^1^].

In this article, we will show you how to use FSUIPC 5.103 with Prepar3D 4.0, which is an older version of the popular flight simulator. FSUIPC 5.103 was released in December 2017, and it was compatible with P3D 4.0 at that time. However, since then, P3D has been updated to version 4.1 and later versions, which require a newer version of FSUIPC (5.122 or higher). Therefore, if you want to use FSUIPC 5.103 with P3D 4.0, you will need to avoid updating your P3D to a newer version.
 
To use FSUIPC 5.103 with P3D 4.0, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download FSUIPC 5.103 from the link provided by the vendor where you purchased it. If you have lost the link, you can contact the vendor for support.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. Make sure you select the correct folder where your P3D 4.0 is installed.
3. Launch P3D 4.0 and check if FSUIPC is loaded correctly. You should see a message on the screen saying "FSUIPC version 5.103 loaded". You should also see an option to access FSUIPC settings in the Add-ons menu.
4. Open the FSUIPC settings and configure your preferences according to your needs. You can refer to the user manual for more details on how to use FSUIPC features.

That's it! You should now be able to use FSUIPC 5.103 with P3D 4.0 without any issues. However, please note that some features of FSUIPC may not work properly with older versions of P3D, and some features of P3D may not work properly with older versions of FSUIPC. Therefore, it is recommended to update both your P3D and your FSUIPC to the latest versions available if possible.
 
If you have any questions or problems with using FSUIPC 5.103 with P3D 4.0, you can visit the official support forum[^2^] and ask for help from other users or from Pete Dowson himself.
  
In this section, we will show you some examples of how you can use FSUIPC 5.103 with P3D 4.0 to enhance your flight simulation experience.
 
## Joystick Calibration
 
One of the most common uses of FSUIPC is to calibrate your joystick or other controllers to suit your preferences and avoid any unwanted inputs or noises. FSUIPC allows you to adjust the sensitivity, dead zones, axes assignments, and button assignments of your controllers. You can also create different profiles for different aircraft or scenarios.
 
To calibrate your joystick with FSUIPC 5.103, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Open the FSUIPC settings and go to the Axis Assignment tab.
2. Move your joystick or controller and see which axis is detected by FSUIPC. You can also press the Rescan button to refresh the detection.
3. Select the axis you want to calibrate and choose the type of control you want to assign to it from the drop-down menu. For example, if you want to assign the X axis of your joystick to the ailerons, select Ailerons from the menu.
4. Click on the OK button to confirm your assignment.
5. Go to the Joystick Calibration tab and select the axis you have assigned in the previous step.
6. Move your joystick or controller to the extreme positions and click on the Set buttons to define the minimum and maximum values for your axis. You can also adjust the slope curve and the null zone for your axis.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 for any other axes or controllers you want to calibrate.
8. Click on the OK button to save your calibration settings.

You can also assign buttons or switches to various functions using FSUIPC. To do that, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Open the FSUIPC settings and go to the Buttons + Switches tab.
2. Press the button or switch you want to assign and see which number is detected by FSUIPC. You can also press the Rescan button to refresh the detection.
3. Select the button or switch you want to assign and check the Select for FS control box.
4. Choose the type of control you want to assign to it from the drop-down menu. For example, if you want to assign a button to toggle the landing gear, select Gear (toggle) from the menu.
5. Click on the OK button to confirm your assignment.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for any other buttons or switches you want to assign.
7. Click on the OK button to save your assignment settings.

You can also create different profiles for different aircraft or scenarios using FSUIPC. To do that, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Open the FSUIPC settings and go to the Axis Assignment tab.
2. Click on the Profile Specific box and enter a name for your profile in the text box below. For example, if you want to create a profile for a Boeing 737, enter Boeing 737 as your profile name.
3. Assign and calibrate your axes as described in steps 2-6 above.
4. Go to the Buttons + Switches tab and assign your buttons and switches as described in steps 2-5 above.
5. Go to any other tabs that you want to customize for your profile and make your changes accordingly.
6. Click on the OK button to save your profile settings.

You can switch between different profiles using FSUIPC by selecting them from the Profile drop-down menu in any of the tabs. You can also make a profile active for a specific aircraft by selecting it from the Aircraft Specific list in any of the tabs.
